Welcome to the IBM Labs. 

We are happy to provide you with these 2 labs :

- LAB1 : discovery of quantum computing with qiskit and IBM backends, basic exercices and challenges
- LAB2 : should be done after LAB1 or is you already have some quantum computing practice.

Any question, support, coaching during the event : just ask !
